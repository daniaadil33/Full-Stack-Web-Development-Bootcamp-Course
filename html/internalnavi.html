                Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) was initially constituted as the University of Cochin through an Act of Kerala Government on 10th July 1971. The University of Cochin was re‐constituted as Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) in February 1986, redefining its objectives as "promoting Graduate and Post‐Graduate studies and Advanced Research in Applied Sciences, Technology, Industry, Commerce, Management and Social Sciences." CUSAT is now a world-ranking university with the specific purpose of developing higher education, emphasizing post-graduate studies and research in applied science, technology, industry, humanities, and commerce. CUSAT has consecutively been figured in the Times Higher Education World Ranking since 2017.

CUSAT has also found a place in the QS World University Ranking and the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the India Government.

            Cast in the mold of a federal University, CUSAT is now a premier Science and Technology University in the country, re‐accredited with NAAC 'A+' Grade in 3rd cycle. During the intervening four and half decades, CUSAT has made quantum leaps in its academic pursuits and has spread its wings far and wide, encompassing the novel and emerging realms of the horizon of knowledge. The University has entered into several collaborative ventures with reputed Universities and Institutions worldwide. Scores of National and International academic discourses, seminars, workshops, etc., are held in the University every year, providing opportunities to the student community to update themselves in their respective fields of study. The Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR), one among the many Centres of excellence of CUSAT, is included in the Prime Minister's "Make in India Program."
